## Simple Summary
This CIP replicates [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541), which disallows new code starting with the `0xEF` byte to be deployed.

## Motivation
Ethereum's subsequent upgrades, such as the EVM Object Format and EOA account code, rely on [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541). Supporting this EIP is a prerequisite to ensure future compatibility with the Ethereum network.

## Specification
Same as [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541).

## Rationale
N/A

## Backwards Compatibility
This CIP is Spec Breaking.

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
