## Simple Summary

This CIP introduces new opcodes to enable event-driven execution model in EVM.

## Abstract

This CIP introduces a set of novel new opcodes to enhance the EVM in Conflux
(cEVM). The enhanced cEVM  will enable developers to build fully autonomous
smart contracts. It introduces another way for contracts to interact with each
other. Contracts in the enhanced cEVM can emit signal events, on which other
contracts can listen. Once an event is triggered, corresponding handler
functions are automatically executed as signal transactions. This enhancement
can significantly simplify the execution flow of many decentralized
applications espeically DeFi applications. It can also avoid security risks
such as front-run attacks by miners.
