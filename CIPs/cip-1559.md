## Simple Summary
This CIP seeks to introduce Ethereum's [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) fee structure to Conflux while accounting for the unique aspects of the Conflux network, such as its dual space structure, tree-graph consensus mechanism, and random transaction packing.

## Abstract

This CIP proposes the introduction of EIP-1559 to Conflux. However, due to significant architectural differences, a direct implementation of EIP-1559 is not feasible for Conflux. Key differences include two spaces with potential individual base prices, a tree-graph structure where an epoch encompasses multiple blocks with different block base prices, and challenges in retrieving gas usage from parent blocks due to delayed execution mechanisms. This CIP proposes a tailored version of EIP-1559 to fit Conflux's architecture, aiming to enhance user experience and network efficiency by adjusting the fee structure accordingly.

## Motivation
Since the introduction of EIP-1559, most EVM-compatible blockchains have adopted this feature, which provides more efficient gas price mechanisms and improves economic efficiency. EIP-1559 has proven effective in stabilizing transaction fees and improving block space utilization in Ethereum. However, Conflux's unique characteristics introduce the following specific challenges:
1. Dual space operation that may necessitate distinct base prices.
2. Tree-graph architecture where multiple blocks in a single epoch complicate the straightforward application of base fees.
3. Delayed execution mechanisms that obscure immediate visibility of gas used from parent blocks.
4. Random transaction packing that can lead to high-fee transactions remaining unprocessed even if the base gas price drops.

These issues necessitate a custom approach to integrate EIP-1559's benefits into Conflux, enhancing network predictability and economic operations without compromising the unique strengths of Conflux's architecture.

## Specification

This CIP will be activated at a specified block height, resulting in the following changes:

**NOTE:** in the content below, "gas price" and "fee per gas" are used interchangeably, since CIPs and EIPs use different terms. 

### Transaction Format

This CIP introduces four types of transactions.

#### eSpace

- Transactions in [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) format.
- Transactions in [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) format.

#### Core Space

Core space introduces a typed transaction envelope similar to [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) in this hardfork: `b'cfx' || TransactionType || TransactionPayload`, where `b'cfx'` is the byte format of the string `cfx` (`0x636678`), `TransactionType` is the transaction type, and `TransactionPayload` is the actual transaction content.

- **Core space type 1 transaction**: The payload corresponds to [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) and its full format is defined as: `b'cfx' || 0x01 || rlp([txMeta, signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS])`, where:
  - `txMeta` is `rlp([nonce, gasPrice, gas, to, value, storageLimit, epochHeight, chainId, data, accessList])`
  - The `signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS` elements represent a secp256k1 signature over `keccak256(b'cfx' || 0x01 || txMeta)`

- **Core space type 2 transaction**: The payload corresponds to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) and its full format is defined as: `b'cfx' || 0x02 || rlp([txMeta, signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS])`, where:
  - `txMeta` is `rlp([nonce, maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas, gas, to, value, storageLimit, epochHeight, chainId, data, accessList])`
  - The `signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS` elements represent a secp256k1 signature over `keccak256(b'cfx' || 0x02 || txMeta)`

**NOTE:** This CIP only supports the **FORMAT** of **Core space type 1 transaction**, without providing gas discounts for accessing storage keys in the access list.

### Block Header

Conflux will add a new field to the block header (encoded in RLP format), which will be inserted in the previous position of custom field. This new field will be a list with two elements: `base_gas_price_in_core_space` and `base_gas_price_in_espace`.

### Independent Gas Limit Calculation

After the activation of this CIP, the gas limits for the core space and espace will be calculated independently. Previously, in [CIP-90](cip-90.md), the consensus protocol only constrained the gas limit for espace and the total gas limit, without a separate restriction for the core space gas limit.

The total gas limit and gas target for the block will be calculated in accordance with EIP-1559 standards, including special handling at the activation height. The `gas_limit_for_core_space` will be 0.9 times the block gas limit, and the `gas_limit_for_espace` will be 0.5 times the block gas limit.

This change will provide a relatively stable gas limit for the core space. Before this CIP, CIP-90 stipulated that when blocks could package espace transactions, half of the gas limit could be allocated to espace, potentially leaving less than half for the core space.

### Adjustment Based on the Current Block's Gas Limit

When calculating the expected base fee per gas, EIP-1559 uses the gas used by the parent block. In contrast, this CIP will use the current block's gas limit for this calculation.

### Uniform Base Gas Price for the Epoch

During transaction execution, the entire epoch's base gas price will be determined by its pivot block. Transactions on non-pivot blocks may have a `max_gas_price` less than this value will be treated as failed. This could lead to a large number of transaction failures. [CIP-137](cip-137.md) will address the issue.

### Special Handling for Espace Blocks

Since espace transactions can only be packaged at heights that are multiples of 5, the `base_gas_price_in_espace` for espace must remain unchanged at other heights.

### Modifications to Receipts

While EIP-1559 did not alter the content included in receipts, encoding follows the format specified by [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718). Since the introduction of espace within CIP-90, Conflux at the consensus level (computing the receipt root in the block header) has not been compatible with Ethereum's receipt format, instead using the core space format.

In this CIP, a field will be added to receipts for transactions from both spaces to indicate how much fee has been burnt.

## Rationale

### Why Maintain Gas Limit Stability for the Core Space instead of the Total

If the gas limit of core space blocks fluctuates based on whether espace transactions are packed, the price adjustment mechanism of EIP-1559 could become unstable due to the variable gas limits in core space. Furthermore, after the introduction of EIP-1559, the gas limit of a block could potentially fluctuate between 0 and 2 times the gas target, eliminating the necessity to maintain a consistent transaction gas limit for each block.

### Why Adjust Gas Using the Current Block's Gas Limit

Due to the presence of a deferred execution mechanism, it is impossible to adjust the base gas price using the gas used; therefore, the gas limit is used instead. Using the gas limit from the previous block would require accessing transaction blocks from five heights prior for espace blocks, which would increase the overhead in the consensus process.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
N/A

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
N/A

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
