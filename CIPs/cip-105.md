## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.-->
Set a minimal requirement for the DAO vote count based on its ratio to PoS staking amount.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
In the DAO vote mechanism of CIP#94, if only a small amount of tokens participate to vote, the cost to manipulate the result will be low. This CIP proposes to add a minimal requirement for the DAO vote. If the vote count is less than a certain percentage of the PoS staking amount at the start of the vote period, this vote will not take effects and the on-chain parameters remain unchanged.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Conflux protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The motivation is to make the DAO vote more robust so that the result will not be manipulated by only few tokens.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Conflux platforms ([conflux-rust](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-rust)).-->
When a voting period starts, the amount of the current total PoS staking tokens is recorded in the state as system storage entries. When the period ends, the value of the recorded current PoS staking tokens is moved to the settled one and the current one is updated again.

When a settled vote should be used, if the total vote counts is less than 5% of the recorded PoS staking amount, the vote will be ignored and the on-chain parameters will not be changed.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
We use the PoS staking tokens at the start of a voting period instead of the value at the end of a period so it cannot be manipulated at the last moments. It remains unchanged when an account casts its vote.

Whether the vote count is sufficient is available when we settle a vote. The vote that should be ignored is still moved to the settled value so that the information remains available for a while.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
This is backwards incompatible.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
TBA.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
TBA.

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
TBA.
