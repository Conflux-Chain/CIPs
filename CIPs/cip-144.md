## Simple Summary
Introduce the KZG point evaluation precompiled contract.

## Abstract
Introduce the KZG point evaluation precompiled contract as [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#point-evaluation-precompile).

## Motivation
EIP-4844 with this precompiled contract has been activated EIP-1153 in the Cancun upgrade. Although this precompiled contract is introduced within EIP-4844, its functionality—KZG commitment verification—could be applied in a broader context. Therefore, even though Conflux does not support EIP-4844, implementing this precompiled contract is still necessary.

Currently, the Solidity compiler generates bytecode for the newest EVM by default, which has activated EIP-1153 in the Cancun upgrade. Supporting this opcode can achieve maximum compatibility with Ethereum.

## Specification
Same as precompiled contract in [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#point-evaluation-precompile).

## Rationale
N/A

## Backwards Compatibility
This CIP is Spec Breaking.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
N/A

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
N/A

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
