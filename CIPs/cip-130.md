CIP No.: 130
Title: Aligning Gas Limit with Transaction Size

## Simple Summary
The Conflux block packaging process has two constraints â€“ gas limit and transaction size limit. Within the existing constraints and gas planning, size-dominated transactions can use up the block's capacity at a lower cost than gas-dominated transactions.

This CIP aims to fix this misalignment by introducing an additional rule for transactions.

## Abstract
This CIP proposes a new rule: a transaction's gas limit should be no less than 100 times the byte size of its call data. Transactions not meeting this criterion will be deemed invalid, and blocks containing such transactions will also be considered invalid. This change aims to rectify the pricing imbalance, ensuring fair resource allocation and efficient block utilization within the Conflux network.

## Motivation
The Conflux protocol currently operates under constraints of a 30 million gas limit and a 300KB transaction size limit, which reveals an exchange rate between transaction data size and gas limit. pricing misalignment: 1 byte of transaction data equates to 100 gas. 

However, current gas planning charges less than 100 gas per byte in transaction calldata. This discrepancy can lead to 'inscription'-like transactions, which record calldata without execution, occupying block capacity at a disproportionately lower cost. 

## Specification
At the given block height, transactions do not satisfy `tx.gas_limit >= tx.calldata * 100` will be regared invalid.

## Backwards Compatibility
This CIP is Spec Breaking.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
N/A

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
