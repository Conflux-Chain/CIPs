## Simple Summary
This proposal aims to address discovered bugs in the Conflux blockchain concerning the feature of clearing the contract whitelist upon contract deletion. Currently, when a contract is deleted and replaced by a new one at the same address, the new contract is not required to inherit the whitelist of the previous contract. However, due to technical challenges in resolving existing bugs and its limited use, this proposal suggests removing this feature.


## Abstract
During the recent Conflux execution layer reconstruction, [two bugs were identified](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-rust/pull/2730) related to the "clear contract whitelist on contract deletion" feature. Fixing these bugs in the existing Conflux's MPT (Merkle Patricia Tree) version is challenging. 

The feature was initially introduced amidst some controversy to improve user experience in corner cases, particularly when a contract is killed and another is deployed at the same address, allowing the new deployer to avoid inheriting the old contract's whitelist. 

This CIP suggests removing this feature. When a contract is deleted, its whitelist will be kept. 

## Motivation
Given the difficulty in resolving incorrect behaviors introduced by this feature, we propose its removal, taking into account three critical factors.

First, no current eco-projects rely on this feature, suggesting its removal would not adversely impact current operations.

Second, the Ethereum community's consideration of eliminating similar 'kill contract' opcode suggests such features will likely become obsolete.

Third, even without this feature, "inheriting obligations (like a whitelist) in contract redeployment at the same address" remains reasonable.

## Specification
After the given block number, the whitelist will not be removed upon contract deletion. 

## Rationale
N/A

## Backwards Compatibility
This CIP is Spec Breaking.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
N/A

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
