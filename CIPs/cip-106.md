## Simple Summary
When some states in Conflux coreSpace are released in a transaction, a proportion of the storage collateral will be burned. This proportion can be decided based on the on-chain DAO vote. 

## Abstract
Burning a DAO-adjustable proportion of the storage collateral when refunding.

## Motivation
This is to introduce some burning scenarios and mechanisms to mitigate the continuous inflation of CFX tokens. This will improve the tokenomics of Conflux. 

## Specification
Assuming *m* CFX is the storage collateral volume associated with some states and *p* is the proportion of the storage collateral to be burned. When the states are released in a transaction, *m*\*(1-*p*) CFX will be refunded to the owner of the states, and the left will be burned. The *p* can be voted as 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.
