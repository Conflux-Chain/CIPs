## Simple Summary

In this CIP we propose to remove whitelist keys for a contract at the time when the contract itself is removed.

## Abstract

A contract can be deleted by `selfdestruct` (corresponds to SUICIDE opcode), or by calling `destroy` of admin internal contract. However it was forgotten to remove whitelist keys for the contract.

## Motivation

Nothing more than the Abstract section.

## Specification

The whitelist keys of a contract will be deleted at the time when the contract itself is removed. The removal can happen at `selfdestruct`, or `destroy` of admin internal contract call. The removal may happen at dust-removal as well.

## Rationale

Nothing to see here.

## Backwards Compatibility

This CIP changes the world-state content, therefore the state-root of the blockchain.

## Test Cases

Test case 1.

Initialize contract account `C` with two whitelist keys `W1`. `W2`

In an epoch, transaction `t1` destroys `C`, remove the whitelist keys `W1`, `W2` in transaction `t2`, `t3`, remove a non-existent whitelist key `W3` in transaction `t4`. The execution of `t2`, `t3` and `t4` should be equivalent.

After the epoch transaction, assert that the whitelist keys `W1` and `W2` are moved from the storage.

## Security Considerations
There is no security impact of this CIP.
