## Simple Summary

This CIP introduces new builtin/internal contract functions to enable
fast verification of VDF in Conflux. This is to support potential random
beacon development for gaming applications on Conflux.

## Abstract

VDF is the most promising solution for building randomness beacons on Conflux.
Directly using cEVM to code the verification of VDF may consume a lot of gas.
This CIP proposes to identify the VDF type that Conflux will promote to use and
then introduce builtin/internal contract functions to reduce the gas cost of
its verification.
