CIP No.: 141
Title: Disable Subroutine Opcodes
Author: Chenxing Li (@ChenxingLi)
Status: Draft
Type: Spec Breaking

## Simple Summary
Disable the opcode `BEGIN_SUB (0x5c)` `RETURN_SUB (0x5d)` `JUMP_SUB (0x5e)` instructions for subroutines.

## Abstract
Disable the opcode `BEGIN_SUB (0x5c)` `RETURN_SUB (0x5d)` `JUMP_SUB (0x5e)` instructions, which are from the withdrawn [EIP-2315](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315).

## Motivation
In the Cancun upgrade, [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153) and [EIP-5656](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656) defines different opcode at the `0x5c` to `0x5e`. Conflux should support the opcodes to achieve maximum compatibility with Ethereum.

## Specification
At the specified block number, these opcodes will be considered invalid unless other opcodes with the same numbers are activated.

## Rationale
The opcode related to subroutine comes from the now-deprecated EIP-2315 in Ethereum. Since neither Ethereum nor other major EVM-compatible chains ever supported the subroutine feature, and because Conflux's ecosystem reuses Ethereum's tools, we have ample reason to believe that no active ecosystem relies on this feature. Therefore, it is safe to remove it.

## Backwards Compatibility
This CIP is Spec Breaking.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
