## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.-->
Increase the PoS lock/unlock/retire periods back to the values before CIP113.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
The PoS lock/unlock/retire period was halved after CIP113 because the round time was halved. This CIP intends to restore the original period length, which is 13 days for locking, 1 day for unlocking, and 3 hours for force retiring, by doubling the number of rounds in a PoS epoch and the number of views for locking/unlocking.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Conflux protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The current 1.5h force retire time is too short for node operators. And changing the lock/unlock/retire time is not intended for CIP113.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Conflux platforms ([conflux-rust](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-rust)).-->

The number of rounds in a PoS epoch is changed from 60 to 120, so the time for a PoS epoch is changed back to the original value before CIP113. And the number of epochs needed for force retiring remains 3 continous PoS epochs, so the force retire time is also restored.

The number of views for PoS stake locking and unlocking is doubled after this CIP, which becomes 2880 views for locking and 37440 views for unlocking. 

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
It's possible that a simple restart for upgrading the node makes it retire. A 3h period is more user-friendly and does not affect the network safety.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
This is spec breaking.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
N/A

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
