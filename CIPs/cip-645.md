## Motivation
Ethereum development tools like Remix implement their own EVM engines. Inconsistent gas pricing in Conflux eSpace may cause developers to experience discrepancies between testing and deployment environments. Ensuring gas pricing alignment between Conflux eSpace and Ethereum is crucial for maintaining EVM compatibility and providing a seamless development experience.

## Specification

### eSpace Gas Pricing Adjustments
Due to Conflux's unique consensus mechanism and forward compatibility with the existing ecosystem, some inconsistencies will remain. This section outlines the specific adjustments.

**1. Modified Gas Price Constants**

The following gas price constants in eSpace will be adjusted to align with Ethereum:

- `G_sset`: 20000 → 40000  
- `G_newaccount`: 25000 → 50000  
- `G_codedeposit`: 200 → 400  

**2. COINBASE Address Handling**

In Conflux, the coinbase (which receives mining rewards and transaction fees) resides in the Core Space. Although the eSpace opcode `COINBASE` retrieves a hex20 address, it refers to the Core Space address and has no relation to the eSpace address with the same hex20. This means the address with the same name in eSpace is not considered "warm" because it is not the coinbase ([EIP-2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929)). 

**3. BLOCKHASH Gas Pricing**

For the current block height `n`, Ethereum supports querying blocks in the range `[n-256, n-1]`, while Conflux supports `[n-65535, n]` ([CIP-133](./cip-133.md)). The gas pricing for `BLOCKHASH` is adjusted as follows:
- Ethereum: 20 gas (all cases)  
- Conflux: 2100 gas (for the range `[n-65535, n-257]`); 100 gas (other cases)  

### Core Space Adjustments
The following adjustments are made to Core Space to accommodate Conflux's storage collateral mechanism and unique architecture:

**1. Ignoring storage occupation and release in EIP-2200**

Due to Conflux's use of storage collateral instead of gas fees for storage payment, both the `original value` and `new value` are treated as non-zero in Core Space when implementing [EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200) rules, ignoring storage entry occupancy and release effects when computing the gas cost of `SSTORE`.

**2. Built-in Contract Handling**

- All built-in contracts are treated as warm addresses.  
- All storage entries of built-in contracts do not follow the warm and cold mechanism; they are consistently treated as cold.  

### Contract Code Size Limit for both Spaces
Conflux's contract code size limit of 49152 (compared to Ethereum's 24576) will remain unchanged. For [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860), the `initcode size limit` is set to 49152, aligning with Ethereum. Notably, the `initcode size limit` is no longer twice the `contract code size limit`.

## Rationale

### Gas Price Constants  
As a high-performance blockchain, Conflux's resource costs for CPU and storage differ from Ethereum's. While Conflux has a gas limit budget over 10 times larger than Ethereum's, it does not aim for a 10-fold increase in ledger space. 
In Core Space, storage collateral was introduced to distinguish between computational and storage resources. However, in eSpace, to maintain compatibility, gas is still used to measure storage costs.  
So in [CIP-90](./cip-90.md), an additional rule was adopted: all gas costs related to storage usage were set to twice those of Ethereum's EVM. This CIP continues this design to ensure consistency and alignment with the existing ecosystem.

### The Number 645  
During the drafting of this CIP, the next available PR number was 155. However, a guiding principle for CIPs is to avoid using numbers that coincide with well-known EIPs (e.g., EIP-20, EIP-721) discussing different topics. [EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) represents the most common transaction type in Ethereum prior to the introduction of EIP-1559.  
Given the significance of this CIP, which implements nine EIPs in a single proposal, the CIP editors decided to assign it a distinctive number. The number **645** was chosen as it visually resembles the uppercase letters **GAS**, symbolizing the core focus of this proposal.

## Backwards Compatibility
This CIP is spec-breaking.

## Security Considerations
The adjustments to gas pricing and storage handling are designed to mitigate potential security risks while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum's EVM. Developers should review the changes to ensure their contracts function as expected under the new rules.
