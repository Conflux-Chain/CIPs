## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.-->
Add node type information in Status message to let its peers know whether it is an Archive, Full, or Light node.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Currently, there is no way for a Conflux node to let its peers know what type it is, in the sense of Archive, Full, or Light. This CIP fix this issue by adding field of node type in Status message.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Conflux protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Conflux nodes need a way to convey what types they are to their peers, so that nodes can maintain the node type information of their peers and can decide how to choose peers to connect or send messages accordingly. For example, when light nodes want to retrieve old-era receipts or full nodes are in catch-up phase, they might need to query an archive node. 

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Conflux platforms ([conflux-rust](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-rust)).-->
TBD

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
TBD

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
The proposed fix is protocol-breaking since it involves message format changing. It should use protocol versioning mechanism to implement, but at current stage in phase 2 mainnet, I prefer a direct in-place update in current message version.  

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
TBD

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
See [conflux-rust pull request #1701](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-rust/pull/1701).

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
There is no obvious way to verify whether a node tells the truth about its type. But this would not introduce serious security issue. The node which uses this information of its peers will eventually observe the inconsistency between their behaviors and claims, and can demote their reputations accordingly.
