## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.-->
Fix the incorrect encoding and decoding implementation of the `custom` field of block headers.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Currently, in the block header RLP encoding, each element in the `custom` list is appended to the RLP list as raw bytes, where its RLP-encoded data should be appended instead. Decoding such a field as raw bytes may result in a different `custom` field from the encoded data.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Conflux protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
We should encode and decode the `custom` field as expected so that the correct data can be extracted.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Conflux platforms ([conflux-rust](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-rust)).-->
Each element of the `custom` field would be appended to the block header RLP list normally, which means its RLP-encoded data are appended. And decoding will also treat each element as RLP-encoded bytes.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Nothing needs to be explained. 

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
This changes the block header encoding and decoding in P2P transmission, so it's protocol breaking.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
TBA

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
N/A

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
This fix will be enabled with a hardfork, so all upgraded nodes should encode/decode the block headers with the same rule.
