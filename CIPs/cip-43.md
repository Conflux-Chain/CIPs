## Simple Summary

In this CIP we propose to introduce finality to the Conflux chain via voting
among staked CFX holders. This will increase the confidence of high value
transactions happening on Conflux in future and this will protect Conflux
against potential 51% attacks from PoW.

## Abstract

We propose to use a VRF to select active staked CFX holders to form a finality
committee. The committee is temporary and will rotate periodically every X
blocks/epochs. The committee will cast vote to determine the finality of a
block in the PoW chain. Once a block is final in the PoW chain, all future
miners will have to generate blocks under the chain regardless of the weight
composition of the tree graph. This will effectively protect Conflux chain from
long-range 51% attacks from PoW.
