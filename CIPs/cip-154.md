## Simple Summary
This CIP addresses an implementation error in [CIP-142](./cip-142.md), which incorrectly implemented the `TLOAD` opcode as `SLOAD`. 

## Motivation
[CIP-142](./cip-142.md) was designed to implement [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153), which introduces transient storage opcodes `TLOAD` and `TSTORE`. However, due to an implementation error, `TLOAD` was mistakenly implemented as `SLOAD`, which reads from persistent storage instead of transient storage. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect behavior in smart contracts that rely on transient storage, potentially causing security vulnerabilities or unexpected outcomes.

## Specification
The `TLOAD` opcode should be implemented to read from transient storage, as defined in [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153). The corrected implementation will ensure that `TLOAD` operates on transient storage, which is separate from persistent storage (`SLOAD`).
