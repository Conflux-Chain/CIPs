<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged CIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new CIPs. Note that a CIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your CIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `CIP-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.-->
Migrate [ERC1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820) to Conflux chain.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Use Create2Factory contract in [CIP-31](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/CIPs/blob/master/CIPs/cip-31.md) to deploy a ERC1820Registry contract with a fixed and distinguishable address 0x88887ed889e776bcbe2f0f9932ecfabcdfcd1820. 

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Conflux protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Migrate ERC1820 from Ethereum to Conflux for pseudo-introspection. This CIP also provides a way to deploy the ERC1820Registry contract with same address for different Conflux chains.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Conflux platforms ([conflux-rust](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-rust)).-->

### ERC1820Registry
See [Conflux-ERC1820](https://github.com/Conflux-Dev/Conflux-ERC1820) for smart contract code and compiled bytecode. The difference between it and ERC1820Registry on Ethereum is that, in contract constructor, the admin is removed so that nobody can destory it.

### Create2 Salt
The salt for ERC1820Registry deployment is 300028585979. The deployed contract address is 0x88887ed889e776bcbe2f0f9932ecfabcdfcd1820.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

None.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

This CIP is backward compatible. 

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
TBD


## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
ERC1820Registry is deployed on Conflux mainnet already. The deployment transaction hash is 0x6db23d253a7d400f29d947781152af21f612bc91156331e031ae892c09a7237f.

## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. a CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
None.
